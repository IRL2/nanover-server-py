% Enhanced sampling review
@article{henin2022enhanced,
   abstract = {Enhanced sampling algorithms have emerged as powerful methods to extend the utility of molecular
   dynamics simulations and allow the sampling of larger portions of the configuration space of complex systems
   in a given amount of simulation time. This review aims to present the unifying principles of and differences
   between many of the computational methods currently used for enhanced sampling in molecular simulations of
   biomolecules, soft matter and molecular crystals. In fact, despite the apparent abundance and divergence of
   such methods, the principles at their core can be boiled down to a relatively limited number of statistical
   and physical concepts. To enable comparisons, the various methods are introduced using similar terminology and
   notation. We then illustrate in which ways many different methods combine features of a relatively small number
   of the same enhanced sampling concepts. This review is intended for scientists with an understanding of the
   basics of molecular dynamics simulations and statistical physics who want a deeper understanding of the ideas
   that underlie various enhanced sampling methods and the relationships between them. This living review is intended
   to be updated to continue to reflect the wealth of sampling methods as they continue to emerge in the
   literature.},
