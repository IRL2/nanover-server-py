	such methods, the principles at their core can be boiled down to a relatively limited number of statistical

	abstract = {The main protease (Mpro) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is one focus of drug development efforts for COVID-19.
	Here, we show that interactive molecular dynamics in virtual reality (iMD-VR) is a useful and effective tool for
	creating Mpro complexes. We make these tools and models freely available. iMD-VR provides an immersive environment
	in which users can interact with MD simulations and so build protein complexes in a physically rigorous and
	flexible way. Recently, we have demonstrated that iMD-VR is an effective method for interactive, flexible docking
	of small molecule drugs into their protein targets (Deeks et al. PLoS One 2020, 15, e0228461). Here, we apply this
	approach to both an Mpro inhibitor and an oligopeptide substrate, using experimentally determined crystal
	structures. For the oligopeptide, we test against a crystallographic structure of the original SARS Mpro. Docking
	with iMD-VR gives models in agreement with experimentally observed (crystal) structures. The docked structures
	are also tested in MD simulations and found to be stable. Different protocols for iMD-VR docking are explored,
	e.g., with and without restraints on protein backbone, and we provide recommendations for its use. We find that
	it is important for the user to focus on forming binding interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, and not to rely on
	using simple metrics (such as RMSD), in order to create realistic, stable complexes. We also test the use of apo
	(uncomplexed) crystal structures for docking and find that they can give good results. This is because of the
	flexibility and dynamic response allowed by the physically rigorous, atomically detailed simulation approach of
	iMD-VR. We make our models (and interactive simulations) freely available. The software framework that we use,
	Narupa, is open source, and uses commodity VR hardware, so these tools are readily accessible to the wider
	research community working on Mpro (and other COVID-19 targets). These should be widely useful in drug development,
	in education applications, e.g., on viral enzyme structure and function, and in scientific communication more
	generally.},

	their respective crystallographic protein-ligand binding poses within 5–10 minutes. Following a brief training
	phase, our studies shown that iMD-VR novices were able to generate unbinding and rebinding pathways on similar
	timescales as iMD-VR experts, with the majority able to recover binding poses within 2.15 Å RMSD of the
	crystallographic binding pose. These results indicate that iMD-VR affords sufficient control for users to carry

	abstract = {As molecular scientists have made progress in their ability to engineer nanoscale
	molecular structure, we face new challenges in our ability to engineer molecular dynamics (MD)
	and flexibility. Dynamics at the molecular scale differs from the familiar mechanics of everyday
	objects because it involves a complicated, highly correlated, and three-dimensional many-body
	dynamical choreography which is often nonintuitive even for highly trained researchers. We
	recently described how interactive molecular dynamics in virtual reality (iMD-VR) can help to
	meet this challenge, enabling researchers to manipulate real-time MD simulations of flexible
	structures in 3D. In this article, we outline various efforts to extend immersive technologies
	to the molecular sciences, and we introduce "Narupa," a flexible, open-source, multiperson iMD-VR
	software framework which enables groups of researchers to simultaneously cohabit real-time
	simulation environments to interactively visualize and manipulate the dynamics of molecular
	structures with atomic-level precision. We outline several application domains where iMD-VR
	is facilitating research, communication, and creative approaches within the molecular sciences,
	including training machines to learn potential energy functions, biomolecular conformational
	sampling, protein-ligand binding, reaction discovery using "on-the-fly" quantum chemistry, and
	transport dynamics in materials. We touch on iMD-VR's various cognitive and perceptual
