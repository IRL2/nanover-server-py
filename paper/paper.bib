	abstract = {Compared with rapid accumulation of protein sequences from high-throughput DNA sequencing, obtaining experimental 3D structures of proteins is still much more difficult, making protein structure prediction (PSP) potentially very useful. Currently, a vast majority of PSP efforts are based on data mining of known sequences, structures and their relationships (informatics-based). However, if closely related template is not available, these methods are usually much less reliable than experiments. They may also be problematic in predicting the structures of naturally occurring or designed peptides. On the other hand, physics-based methods including molecular dynamics (MD) can utilize our understanding of detailed atomic interactions determining biomolecular structures. In this mini-review, we show that all-atom MD can predict structures of cyclic peptides and other peptide foldamers with accuracy similar to experiments. Then, some notable successes in reproducing experimental 3D structures of small proteins through MD simulations (some with replica-exchange) of the folding were summarized. We also describe advancements of MD-based refinement of structure models, and the integration of limited experimental or bioinformatics data into MD-based structure modeling.},

	abstract = {The calculation of free-energy differences is one of the main challenges in computational biology and biochemistry. Umbrella sampling, biased molecular dynamics (MD), is one of the methods that provide free energy along a reaction coordinate. Here, the method is derived in a historic overview and is compared with related methods like thermodynamic integration, slow growth, steered MD, or the Jarzynski-based fast-growth technique. In umbrella sampling, bias potentials along a (one- or more-dimensional) reaction coordinate drive a system from one thermodynamic state to another (e.g., reactant and product). The intermediate steps are covered by a series of windows, at each of which an MD simulation is performed. The bias potentials can have any functional form. Often, harmonic potentials are used for their simplicity. From the sampled distribution of the system along the reaction coordinate, the change in free energy in each window can be calculated. The windows are then combined by methods like the weighted histogram analysis method or umbrella integration. If the bias potential is adapted to result in an even distribution between the end states, then this whole range can be spanned by one window (adaptive-bias umbrella sampling). In this case, the free-energy change is directly obtained from the bias. The sampling in each window can be improved by replica exchange methods; either by exchange between successive windows or by running additional simulations at higher temperatures. © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.

	abstract = {Atomistic simulations play a central role in many fields of science. However, their usefulness is often limited by the fact that many systems are characterized by several metastable states separated by high barriers, leading to kinetic bottlenecks. Transitions between metastable states are thus rare events that occur on significantly longer timescales than one can simulate in practice. Numerous enhanced sampling methods have been introduced to alleviate this timescale problem, including methods based on identifying a few crucial order parameters or collective variables and enhancing the sampling of these variables. Metadynamics is one such method that has proven successful in a great variety of fields. Here we review the conceptual and theoretical foundations of metadynamics. As demonstrated, metadynamics is not just a practical tool but can also be considered an important development in the theory of statistical mechanics.},

The instantaneous force is defined as the force acting on the coordinate of interest so that when it is subtracted from the equations of motion the acceleration along this coordinate is zero. The formula applies to simulations in which the selected coordinates are either unconstrained or constrained to fixed values. It is shown that in the latter case the formula reduces to the expression previously derived by den Otter and Briels [Mol. Phys. 98, 773 (2000)]. If simulations are carried out without constraining the coordinates of interest, the formula leads to a new method for calculating the free energy changes along these coordinates. This method is tested in two examples — rotation around the C–C bond of 1,2-dichloroethane immersed in water and transfer of fluoromethane across the water-hexane interface. The calculated free energies are compared with those obtained by two commonly used methods. One of them relies on determining the probability density function of finding the system at different values of the selected coordinate and the other requires calculating the average force at discrete locations along this coordinate in a series of constrained simulations. The free energies calculated by these three methods are in excellent agreement. The relative advantages of each method are discussed.},

	abstract = {In the host of numerical schemes devised to calculate free energy differences by way of geometric transformations, the adaptive biasing force algorithm has emerged as a promising route to map complex free-energy landscapes. It relies upon the simple concept that as a simulation progresses, a continuously updated biasing force is added to the equations of motion, such that in the long-time limit it yields a Hamiltonian devoid of an average force acting along the transition coordinate of interest. This means that sampling proceeds uniformly on a flat free-energy surface, thus providing reliable free-energy estimates. Much of the appeal of the algorithm to the practitioner is in its physically intuitive underlying ideas and the absence of any requirements for prior knowledge about free-energy landscapes. Since its inception in 2001, the adaptive biasing force scheme has been the subject of considerable attention, from in-depth mathematical analysis of convergence properties to novel developments and extensions. The method has also been successfully applied to many challenging problems in chemistry and biology. In this contribution, the method is presented in a comprehensive, self-contained fashion, discussing with a critical eye its properties, applicability, and inherent limitations, as well as introducing novel extensions. Through free-energy calculations of prototypical molecular systems, many methodological aspects are examined, from stratification strategies to overcoming the so-called hidden barriers in orthogonal space, relevant not only to the adaptive biasing force algorithm but also to other importance-sampling schemes. On the basis of the discussions in this paper, a number of good practices for improving the efficiency and reliability of the computed free-energy differences are proposed.},

A recent advance is to use VR not only to visualize and interact with molecules, but also to interact with molecular dynamics simulations ‘on the fly’ (interactive molecular dynamics in VR, IMD-VR), which is useful for flexible docking and examining binding processes and conformational changes. Areas Covered: The authors use the term ‘interactive VR’ to refer to software where interactivity is an inherent part of the user VR experience e.g. in making structural modifications or interacting with a physically rigorous molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, as opposed to using VR controllers to rotate and translate the molecule for enhanced visualization. Here, they describe these methods and their application to problems relevant to drug discovery, highlighting the possibilities that they offer in this arena. Expert opinion: The ease of viewing and manipulating molecular structures and dynamics, using accessible VR hardware, and the ability to modify structures on the fly (e.g. adding or deleting atoms) – and for groups of researchers to work together in the same virtual environment – makes modern interactive VR a valuable tool to add to the armory of drug design and development methods.},

We make these tools and models freely available. iMD-VR provides an immersive environment in which users can interact with MD simulations and so build protein complexes in a physically rigorous and flexible way. Recently, we have demonstrated that iMD-VR is an effective method for interactive, flexible docking of small molecule drugs into their protein targets (Deeks et al. PLoS One 2020, 15, e0228461). Here, we apply this approach to both an Mpro inhibitor and an oligopeptide substrate, using experimentally determined crystal structures. For the oligopeptide, we test against a crystallographic structure of the original SARS Mpro. Docking with iMD-VR gives models in agreement with experimentally observed (crystal) structures. The docked structures are also tested in MD simulations and found to be stable. Different protocols for iMD-VR docking are explored, e.g., with and without restraints on protein backbone, and we provide recommendations for its use. We find that it is important for the user to focus on forming binding interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, and not to rely on using simple metrics (such as RMSD), in order to create realistic, stable complexes. We also test the use of apo (uncomplexed) crystal structures for docking and find that they can give good results. This is because of the flexibility and dynamic response allowed by the physically rigorous, atomically detailed simulation approach of iMD-VR. We make our models (and interactive simulations) freely available. The software framework that we use, Narupa, is open source, and uses commodity VR hardware, so these tools are readily accessible to the wider research community working on Mpro (and other COVID-19 targets). These should be widely useful in drug development, in education applications, e.g., on viral enzyme structure and function, and in scientific communication more generally.},

Here, we describe the use of interactive molecular dynamics in virtual reality (iMD-VR) as an accurate low-cost strategy for flexible protein-ligand docking. We outline an experimental protocol which enables expert iMD-VR users to guide ligands into and out of the binding pockets of trypsin, neuraminidase, and HIV-1 protease, and recreate their respective crystallographic protein-ligand binding poses within 5–10 minutes. Following a brief training phase, our studies shown that iMD-VR novices were able to generate unbinding and rebinding pathways on similar timescales as iMD-VR experts, with the majority able to recover binding poses within 2.15 Å RMSD of the crystallographic binding pose. These results indicate that iMD-VR affords sufficient control for users to carry out the detailed atomic manipulations required to dock flexible ligands into dynamic enzyme active sites and recover crystallographic poses, offering an interesting new approach for simulating drug docking and generating binding hypotheses.},

	abstract = {As molecular scientists have made progress in their ability to engineer nanoscale molecular structure, we face new challenges in our ability to engineer molecular dynamics (MD) and flexibility. Dynamics at the molecular scale differs from the familiar mechanics of everyday objects because it involves a complicated, highly correlated, and three-dimensional many-body dynamical choreography which is often nonintuitive even for highly trained researchers. We recently described how interactive molecular dynamics in virtual reality (iMD-VR) can help to meet this challenge, enabling researchers to manipulate real-time MD simulations of flexible structures in 3D. In this article, we outline various efforts to extend immersive technologies to the molecular sciences, and we introduce "Narupa," a flexible, open-source, multiperson iMD-VR software framework which enables groups of researchers to simultaneously cohabit real-time simulation environments to interactively visualize and manipulate the dynamics of molecular structures with atomic-level precision. We outline several application domains where iMD-VR is facilitating research, communication, and creative approaches within the molecular sciences, including training machines to learn potential energy functions, biomolecular conformational sampling, protein-ligand binding, reaction discovery using "on-the-fly" quantum chemistry, and transport dynamics in materials. We touch on iMD-VR's various cognitive and perceptual affordances and outline how these provide research insight for molecular systems. By synergistically combining human spatial reasoning and design insight with computational automation, technologies such as iMD-VR have the potential to improve our ability to understand, engineer, and communicate microscopic dynamical behavior, offering the potential to usher in a new paradigm for engineering molecules and nano-architectures.},

This framework should accelerate progress in nanoscale molecular engineering areas including conformational mapping, drug development, synthetic biology, and catalyst design.

Compared to 3D glasses, this yields a comparably relaxing but much more immersive workplace and provides additional possibilities such as taking molecules into one’s hands, standing up, and walking or teleporting through the models. This VR functionality has been combined with a molecular graphics engine based on Vulkan, a next-generation cross-platform application programming interface (API) for GPUs and the successor of the widely used Open Graphics Library (OpenGL). It is built into the YASARA Model program, which includes many features like small and large molecule builders, electron densities, partial surfaces, contact analysis, coordinate manipulation, and animations. Interactive tutorials are provided to guide modelers into VR and familiarize them with the molecular modeling features.

With interactive MD simulations in VR (iMD-VR), chemists can now interact with these molecular simulations in real-time. Our sense of touch is essential for exploring the properties of physical objects, but recreating this sensory experience for virtual objects poses challenges. Furthermore, employing haptics in the context of molecular simulation is especially difficult since we do not know what molecules actually feel like. In this paper, we build upon previous work that demonstrated how VR-users can distinguish properties of molecules without haptic feedback. We present the results of a gamified two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) psychophysics user study in which we quantify the threshold at which iMD-VR users can differentiate the stiffness of molecular bonds. Our preliminary analysis suggests that participants can sense differences between buckminsterfullerene molecules with different bond stiffness parameters and that this limit may fall within the chemically relevant range. Our results highlight how iMD-VR may facilitate a more embodied way of exploring complex and dynamic molecular systems, enabling chemists to sense the properties of molecules purely by interacting with them in VR.},

Currently, it is extremely challenging to perform MD simulations of large-scale structural rearrangements in proteins that occur on millisecond timescales or beyond, as this requires very significant computational resources, or the use of cumbersome “collective variable” enhanced sampling protocols. Here, we describe a framework that combines ensemble MD simulations and virtual reality visualization (eMD-VR) to enable users to interactively generate realistic descriptions of large amplitude, millisecond timescale protein conformational changes in proteins. Detailed tests demonstrate that eMD-VR substantially decreases the computational cost of folding simulations of a WW domain, without the need to define collective variables a priori. We further show that eMD-VR generated pathways can be combined with Markov state models to describe the thermodynamics and kinetics of large-scale loop motions in the enzyme cyclophilin A. Our results suggest eMD-VR is a powerful tool for exploring protein energy landscapes in bioengineering efforts.},

	abstract = {While the primary bottleneck to a number of computational workflows was not so long ago limited by processing power, the rise of machine learning technologies has resulted in an interesting paradigm shift, which places increasing value on issues related to data curation—that is, data size, quality, bias, format, and coverage. Increasingly, data-related issues are equally as important as the algorithmic methods used to process and learn from the data. Here we introduce an open-source graphics processing unit-accelerated neural network (NN) framework for learning reactive potential energy surfaces (PESs). To obtain training data for this NN framework, we investigate the use of real-time interactive ab initio molecular dynamics in virtual reality (iMD-VR) as a new data curation strategy that enables human users to rapidly sample geometries along reaction pathways. Focusing on hydrogen abstraction reactions of CN radical with isopentane, we compare the performance of NNs trained using iMD-VR data versus NNs trained using a more traditional method, namely, molecular dynamics (MD) constrained to sample a predefined grid of points along the hydrogen abstraction reaction coordinate. Both the NN trained using iMD-VR data and the NN trained using the constrained MD data reproduce important qualitative features of the reactive PESs, such as a low and early barrier to abstraction. Quantitative analysis shows that NN learning is sensitive to the data set used for training. Our results show that user-sampled structures obtained with the quantum chemical iMD-VR machinery enable excellent sampling in the vicinity of the minimum energy path (MEP). As a result, the NN trained on the iMD-VR data does very well predicting energies that are close to the MEP but less well predicting energies for “off-path” structures. The NN trained on the constrained MD data does better predicting high-energy off-path structures, given that it included a number of such structures in its training set.},

	abstract = {The ability to understand and engineer molecular structures relies on having accurate descriptions of the energy as a function of atomic coordinates. Here, we outline a new paradigm for deriving energy functions of hyperdimensional molecular systems, which involves generating data for low-dimensional systems in virtual reality (VR) to then efficiently train atomic neural networks (ANNs). This generates high-quality data for specific areas of interest within the hyperdimensional space that characterizes a molecule’s potential energy surface (PES). We demonstrate the utility of this approach by gathering data within VR to train ANNs on chemical reactions involving fewer than eight heavy atoms. This strategy enables us to predict the energies of much higher-dimensional systems, e.g., containing nearly 100 atoms. Training on datasets containing only 15k geometries, this approach generates mean absolute errors around 2 kcal mol−1. This represents one of the first times that an ANN-PES for a large reactive radical has been generated using such a small dataset. Our results suggest that VR enables the intelligent curation of high-quality data, which accelerates the learning process.},

	abstract = {The emerging fields of citizen science and gamification reformulate scientific problems as games or puzzles to be solved. Through engaging the wider non-scientific community, significant breakthroughs may be made by analyzing citizen-gathered data. In parallel, recent advances in virtual reality (VR) technology are increasingly being used within a scientific context and the burgeoning field of interactive molecular dynamics in VR (iMD-VR) allows users to interact with dynamical chemistry simulations in real time. Here, we demonstrate the utility of iMD-VR as a medium for gamification of chemistry research tasks. An iMD-VR “game” was designed to encourage users to explore the reactivity of a particular chemical system, and a cohort of 18 participants was recruited to playtest this game as part of a user study. The reaction game encouraged users to experiment with making chemical reactions between a propyne molecule and an OH radical, and “molecular snapshots” from each game session were then compiled and used to map out reaction pathways. The reaction network generated by users was compared to existing literature networks demonstrating that users in VR capture almost all the important reaction pathways. Further comparisons between humans and an algorithmic method for guiding molecular dynamics show that through using citizen science to explore these kinds of chemical problems, new approaches and strategies start to emerge.},

	abstract = {The reemergence of virtual reality (VR) in the past few years has led to affordable, high-quality commodity hardware that can offer new ways to teach, communicate, and engage with complex concepts. In a higher-education context, these immersive technologies make it possible to teach complex molecular topics in a way that may aid or even supersede traditional approaches such as molecular models, textbook images, and traditional screen-based computational environments. In this work we describe a study involving 22 third-year UK undergraduate chemistry students who undertook a traditional computational chemistry class complemented by an additional component which we designed to utilize real-time interactive molecular dynamics simulations in VR (iMD-VR). Exploiting the flexibility of an open-source iMD-VR framework which we recently described, the students were given three short tasks to complete in iMD-VR: (1) interactive rearrangement of the chorismate molecule to prephenate using forces obtained from density functional theory calculations; (2) unbinding of chorismate from the active site chorismate mutase enzyme using molecular mechanics forces calculated in real-time; and (3) docking of chorismate with chorismate mutase using real-time molecular mechanics forces. A student survey indicated that most students found the iMD-VR component more engaging than the traditional approach, and also that it improved their perceived educational outcomes and their interest in continuing on in the field of computational sciences.},

	abstract = {We describe a two-step approach for combining interactive molecular dynamics in virtual reality (iMD-VR) with free energy (FE) calculation to explore the dynamics of biological processes at the molecular level. We refer to this combined approach as iMD-VR-FE. Stage one involves using a state-of-the-art ‘human-in-the-loop’ iMD-VR framework to generate a diverse range of protein–ligand unbinding pathways, benefitting from the sophistication of human spatial and chemical intuition. Stage two involves using the iMD-VR-sampled pathways as initial guesses for defining a path-based reaction coordinate from which we can obtain a corresponding free energy profile using FE methods. To investigate the performance of the method, we apply iMD-VR-FE to investigate the unbinding of a benzamidine ligand from a trypsin protein. The binding free energy calculated using iMD-VR-FE is similar for each pathway, indicating internal consistency. Moreover, the resulting free energy profiles can distinguish energetic differences between pathways corresponding to various protein–ligand conformations (e.g., helping to identify pathways that are more favourable) and enable identification of metastable states along the pathways. The two-step iMD-VR-FE approach offers an intuitive way for researchers to test hypotheses for candidate pathways in biomolecular systems, quickly obtaining both qualitative and quantitative insight.},

	abstract = {With a growing body of research highlighting the therapeutic potential of experiential phenomenology which diminishes egoic identity and increases one’s sense of connectedness, there is significant interest in how to elicit such ‘self-transcendent experiences’ (STEs) in laboratory contexts. Psychedelic drugs (YDs) have proven particularly effective in this respect, producing subjective phenomenology which reliably elicits intense STEs. With virtual reality (VR) emerging as a powerful tool for constructing new perceptual environments, we describe a VR framework called ‘Isness-distributed’ (Isness-D) which harnesses the unique affordances of distributed multi-person VR to blur conventional self-other boundaries. Within Isness-D, groups of participants co-habit a shared virtual space, collectively experiencing their bodies as luminous energetic essences with diffuse spatial boundaries. It enables moments of ‘energetic coalescence’, a new class of embodied intersubjective experience where bodies can fluidly merge, enabling participants to include multiple others within their self-representation. To evaluate Isness-D, we adopted a citizen science approach, coordinating an international network of Isness-D 'nodes'. We analyzed the results (N = 58) using 4 different self-report scales previously applied to analyze subjective YD phenomenology (the inclusion of community in self scale, ego-dissolution inventory, communitas scale, and the MEQ30 mystical experience questionnaire). Despite the complexities associated with a distributed experiment like this, the Isness-D scores on all 4 scales were statistically indistinguishable from recently published YD studies, demonstrating that distributed VR can be used to design intersubjective STEs where people dissolve their sense of self in the connection to others.},
