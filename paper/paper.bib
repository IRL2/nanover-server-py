	abstract = {Enhanced sampling algorithms have emerged as powerful methods to extend the utility of molecular
	dynamics simulations and allow the sampling of larger portions of the configuration space of complex systems
	in a given amount of simulation time. This review aims to present the unifying principles of and differences
	between many of the computational methods currently used for enhanced sampling in molecular simulations of
	biomolecules, soft matter and molecular crystals. In fact, despite the apparent abundance and divergence of
	such methods, the principles at their core can be boiled down to a relatively limited number of statistical
	and physical concepts. To enable comparisons, the various methods are introduced using similar terminology
	and notation. We then illustrate in which ways many different methods combine features of a relatively small
	number of the same enhanced sampling concepts. This review is intended for scientists with an understanding
	of the basics of molecular dynamics simulations and statistical physics who want a deeper understanding of
	the ideas that underlie various enhanced sampling methods and the relationships between them. This living
	review is intended to be updated to continue to reflect the wealth of sampling methods as they continue to
	emerge in the literature.},

	abstract = {Machine learning plays an important and growing role in molecular simulation. The newest version of the OpenMM molecular dynamics toolkit introduces new features to support the use of machine learning potentials. Arbitrary PyTorch models can be added to a simulation and used to compute forces and energy. A higher-level interface allows users to easily model their molecules of interest with general purpose, pretrained potential functions. A collection of optimized CUDA kernels and custom PyTorch operations greatly improves the speed of simulations. We demonstrate these features in simulations of cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) and the green fluorescent protein chromophore in water. Taken together, these features make it practical to use machine learning to improve the accuracy of simulations with only a modest increase in cost.},

	abstract = {The atomic simulation environment (ASE) is a software package written in the Python programming language with the aim of setting up, steering, and analyzing atomistic simulations. In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array library make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple ‘for-loop’ construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.},
