# How to contribute to NanoVer

The easiest way to contribute to NanoVer is to use the software and report any bugs or issues you run into [here on GitHub](https://github.com/IRL2/nanover-server-py/issues). For code contributions it is best that we discuss first the motivations in a GitHub issue or directly over email (intangible.realities.lab@gmail.com) before you embark on any concrete work.

When reporting issues please make sure you are using the latest versions of the software and state the package version (if you are using NanoVer via Conda). The more specific you are about the conditions leading to the issue, the easier it is for us to determine the cause.
