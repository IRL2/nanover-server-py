    "Although the primary benefit of iMD-VR is the ability to simultaneously visualise and interact with molecular systems, it is often useful to save the trajectory produced in order to run analyses after the simulation is complete. This tutorial demonstrates how to use the in-built functionality of NanoVer to record trajectories from iMD simulations, and how to subsequently replay them. For more information on recording and playback using NanoVer, please refer to the [Recording data](https://irl2.github.io/nanover-docs/concepts/recording.html#recording-data) page of the documentation.\n",
