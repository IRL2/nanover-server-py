    "# Run an OpenMM simulation with NanoVer \n",
    "\n",
    "NanoVer can run OpenMM simulations in two ways: either using [ASE as an interface](../ase/ase_openmm_nanotube.ipynb), or directly using [OpenMM mechanisms](./openmm_nanotube.ipynb). Using the ASE interface offers the most flexibility to customise a workflow; in the [ASE OpenMM graphene example](../ase/ase_openmm_graphene.ipynb) we control the physics parameters of a running simulation from a Jupyter notebook. The ASE interface misses some specific OpenMM features, though; one of the most significant being holonomic constraints. Using the OpenMM mechanisms without ASE as an interface gives access to all of OpenMM features, but may require more work for some customisation needs. Here, we demonstrate how to to use the OpenMM mechanisms with NanoVer."

    "## Preparing an OpenMM simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Running an OpenMM simulation with NanoVer requires two elements: an OpenMM simulation and a NanoVer runner. The simulation is an ordinary OpenMM simulation that we will prepare as normal. We then use this to create an instance of the `OpenMMSimulation` class, which can be passed to NanoVer to run an interactive molecular dynamics (iMD) simulation. An important note is that removing the center of mass motion (as is the default in OpenMM) leads to unintuitive behaviours when you interact with the molecules, particularly for small systems. We recommend deactivating this default flag, i.e. with `removeCMMotion=False`.\n",
